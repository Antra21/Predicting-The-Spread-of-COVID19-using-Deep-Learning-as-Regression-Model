# Predicting-The-Spread-of-COVID19-using-Deep-Learning-as-Regression-Model
This project was built with Keras/Tensorflow with Deep Learning

## Features
1. Dataset used here was a live dataset provide by kaggle.com.
2. Model was trained using Deep Neural Networks.
3. MAE and MSE scores were used for accuracy calculation.
4. Predict the future spread of COVID-19 for next 15 days.
5. This project was developed as a 6th Semester Lockdown Project.
